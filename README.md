## Introduction

I have created this project in order to learn React.

This application is based on a previous application on which I collaborated (see my booklist-builder repository).  While the previous application is full-stack, Book Browser has started as a front-end project.  I will build it out to fully mimic Booklist Builder as I learn more.

## Getting Started

This project has been bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to circumvent the need for a database, I have created a JSON file with a sample of 10 books to populate the homepage.  The JSON file was created by copying API responses from Google Books using Postman.
